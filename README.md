This project is used to measure the accessibilty of various data centers with 
respect to the users located in various geographical regions. The code contains
a file called "start.py" which connects to a central data storage server to get
a list of data centers to connect to. It then pings each data center accordingly
to start measuring the network Characteristics from the client to the data center

The tools used for measuring the network characteristics are
Iperf - http://iperf.sourceforge.net/
Assolo - http://netlab-mn.unipv.it/assolo/
Wbest - http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/papers/wbest/
MultiQ - http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/multiq:imc04.pdf

The measurements generated by each tool are copied to the central data server
which processes the data and stores the values in a database


Please refer to the respective web pages for each tools for more information

This script runs only on Linux machines and currently has executables for i386 architecture
The credit for individual tools used strictly goes to the respective authors as mentioned
